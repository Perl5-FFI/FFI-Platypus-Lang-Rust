NAME

    FFI::Platypus::Lang::Rust - Documentation and tools for using Platypus
    with the Rust programming language

SYNOPSIS

    Rust:

     #![crate_type = "dylib"]
     
     // compile with: rustc add.rs
     
     #[no_mangle]
     pub extern "C" fn add(a:i32, b:i32) -> i32 {
       a+b
     }

    Perl:

     use FFI::Platypus 1.00;
     my $ffi = FFI::Platypus->new( api => 1, lang => 'Rust' );
     $ffi->lib('./libadd.so');
     
     $ffi->attach( add => ['i32', 'i32'] => 'i32' );
     
     print add(1,2), "\n";  # prints 3

DESCRIPTION

    This module provides native Rust types for FFI::Platypus in order to
    reduce cognitive load and concentrate on Rust and forget about C types.
    This document also documents issues and caveats that I have discovered
    in my attempts to work with Rust and FFI.

    This module is somewhat experimental. It is also available for adoption
    for anyone either sufficiently knowledgeable about Rust or eager enough
    to learn enough about Rust. If you are interested, please send me a
    pull request or two on the project's GitHub.

    Note that in addition to using pre-compiled Rust libraries, you can
    bundle Rust code with your Perl distribution using FFI::Build and
    FFI::Build::File::Cargo.

 name mangling

    Rust names are "mangled" to handle features such as modules and the
    fact that some characters in Rust names are illegal machine code symbol
    names. For now that means that you have to tell Rust not to mangle the
    names of functions that you are going to call from Perl. You can
    accomplish that like this:

     #[no_mangle]
     pub extern "C" fn foo() {
     }

    You do not need to add this decoration to functions that you do not
    directly call from Perl. For example:

     fn bar() {
     }
     
     #[no_mangle]
     pub extern "C" fn foo() {
       bar();
     }

 panics

    Be careful about code that might panic!. A panic! across an FFI
    boundary is undefined behavior. You will want to catch the panic with a
    catch_unwind and map to an appropriate result.

     use std::panic::catch_unwind;
     
     #[no_mangle]
     pub extern fn oopsie() -> u32 {
         let result = catch_unwind(|| {
             might_panic();
         });
         match result {
             OK(_) => 0,
             Err(_) -> 1,
         }
     }

METHODS

    Generally you will not use this class directly, instead interacting
    with the FFI::Platypus instance. However, the public methods used by
    Platypus are documented here.

 native_type_map

     my $hashref = FFI::Platypus::Lang::Rust->native_type_map;

    This returns a hash reference containing the native aliases for the
    Rust programming languages. That is the keys are native Rust types and
    the values are libffi native types.

EXAMPLES

    See the above "SYNOPSIS" or the examples directory that came with this
    distribution.

SUPPORT

    If something does not work as advertised, or the way that you think it
    should, or if you have a feature request, please open an issue on this
    project's GitHub issue tracker:

    https://github.com/plicease/FFI-Platypus-Lang-Rust/issues

CONTRIBUTING

    If you have implemented a new feature or fixed a bug then you may make
    a pull reequest on this project's GitHub repository:

    https://github.com/plicease/FFI-Platypus-Lang-Rust/issues

    Caution: if you do this too frequently I may nominate you as the new
    maintainer. Extreme caution: if you like that sort of thing.

    This project's GitHub issue tracker listed above is not Write-Only. If
    you want to contribute then feel free to browse through the existing
    issues and see if there is something you feel you might be good at and
    take a whack at the problem. I frequently open issues myself that I
    hope will be accomplished by someone in the future but do not have time
    to immediately implement myself.

    Another good area to help out in is documentation. I try to make sure
    that there is good document coverage, that is there should be
    documentation describing all the public features and warnings about
    common pitfalls, but an outsider's or alternate view point on such
    things would be welcome; if you see something confusing or lacks
    sufficient detail I encourage documentation only pull requests to
    improve things.
